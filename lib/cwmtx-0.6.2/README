SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION 

CwMtx is a template library written in C++ that provides the matrix
and vector operations that are used extensively in engineering and
science problems. This library also implements block matrices by
allowing sub-matrices to be mapped into a larger matrix.

A special feature of this library is the Quaternion class which
implements quaternion math. Quaternions are very useful for attitude
determination in 3D space because they do not suffer from
singularities. Furthermore, successive rotations and transformations
of vectors can be accomplished by simple quaternion
multiplication. Attitude dynamics can be expressed in a very compact
form using quaternions.

For more information on quaternions and their applications, see:

INSTALLATION

Extract the tar-file in a suitable directory:

> cd where/you/want/it
> tar xzf cwmtx-x.y.z.tar.gz
or
> gunzip -c cwmtx-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xf -
or
> gzip -cd cwmtx-x.y.z.tar.gz | tar xf -

Change into the new directory cwmtx-x.y.z:

> cd cwmtx-x.y.z

The header files can be installed were you want, but you have to edit
the Makefile first. Find the line that reads: 

  INSTALL_DIR=/home/hkuiper/include/cwmtx

and change the path into the location where you want the headers to be
installed. (Probably /usr/local/include is a logical place)

To do the install type:

> make install
