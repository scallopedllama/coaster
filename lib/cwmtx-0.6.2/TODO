* Write a tutorial.

* Further optimisation for speed.

* Implement a better matrix inversion algorithm (one that is faster and uses
  less resources)

* Add capability to aggregate smaller matrices into a new large matrix in
  addition to the current mapping feature which maps smaller matrices into an
  already existing larger matrix.

* Keep improving the test program.
